# AR Puzzle

## What is this about?

A face recognition based puzzle where you have to  align 4 specific people in front of your smartphone to get a code. 

This is just a small web app that does facial recognition on edge (using face-api.js) with some performance tweaks. Since everything is done in the browser, we do not
need a costly backend and also performance is better. You can try it at https://nobisindustries.github.io/ar-puzzle, but don't expect to see any numbers - you most probably
do not have the right face.
